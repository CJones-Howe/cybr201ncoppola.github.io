				<h2>Linux Fundamentals</h2>
				<p>
				As far as the Linux fundamentals go, it's important to understand how to move around the Linux directory, as it'll allow you
				to go where you want. Understanding key commands like <code>cd</code>, <code>ls</code>, and <code>pwd</code> are just the basics
				for moving yourself, checking directories, and printing your location. These commands are just the very beginning, as well. Other
				key commands include <code>cat</code>, <code>nano</code>, and <code>sudo</code>. These commands allow you to read and write to files,
				as well as utilize administrator privileges. It's important to keep in mind the general directory structure of Linux as well, and to
				learn about the locations of system binaries. There's way more to cover with Linux, but I'll leave the most in-depth information within
				the documentation.

				<h2>Networking Concepts</h2>
				<p>
				To best understand the network architecture there are a few core concepts to understand about networks. One of the most major things to
				know is how IP addresses work; it's important to understand private addresses versus public addresses, subnetting, and static configurations
				versus Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP). It's additionally important to learn the way that devices communicate; there are plenty of
				different protocols including: ICMP, TCP and UDP. This leads us into the criticality of knowing the OSI model, the aformentioned protocols are
				all Layer 3 or Transport Layer protocols, while there are also common Layer 7 or Application Layer protocols that are commonly known. These
				would include things like HTTP, SSH, FTP, etc. Understanding how devices utilize these different protocols and how they operate is significant
				to your success as a Blue Team member.

				<h2>Security Best Practices</h2>
				<p>
				It's important to keep in mind security best practices when participating in these competitions. The Red Team will constantly target
				your systems, aiming for the lowest hanging fruit first. There are core security concepts to always keep in mind when defending systems;
				they might seem obvious, but they're extremely important to remember. First of all, change ALL default passwords--no exceptions. Another
				key concept to keep in mind is to check for established connections--Red Team might already be on the system trying to mess with your
				configurations! The final thing to keep in mind is to make backups of all important files--it's not a matter of if things will break, it's
				a matter of when.

				<h2>Technical Writing</h2>
				<p>
				This is a section that is often labeled as "Injects" during competitions. The organizers will provide the competitors with challenges that
				involve more documentation and technical writing skills to complete. These challenges can vary, but include some consistent choices such as
				recreating the network topology, writing a formal letter and executive summary to a C-suite member, implementing a new technology or service
				and then documenting it, and many other options that are more sporadically chosen. It helps to understand how to reduce technical jargon,
				keep your reports concise, focus on a bottom-line-up-front (BLUF) approach, and to address everyone in the most formal way possible.

				<h2>Threat Hunting</h2>
				<p>
				This is essentially the side of this whole main course. Some competitions will allow for incident response reports, which include pointing out
				and explaining all of the Red Team misconfigurations and malicious activity that was discovered during the course of the competition. While this
				is still important, this is often the last thing you will do and requires all of the other steps to be covered in a well-organized manner. If your
				basic network defenses aren't setup and you don't have people keeping up with the injects schedule, then your attention should not be directed here.
				If given the opportunity, threat hunting can be really effective if you can stay ahead of Red Team's malicious deployments; there may be malware on
				a machine, but Red Team can't run everything right away--so if you get rid of it before they can activate it, you'll typically be in a good spot.
