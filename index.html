				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>
				This is your introduction to blue teaming. We'll be learning what blue teaming even is, what the fundamentals are,
				and how to excel at competitions. The best way to get better at anything is to first learn, and then apply those
				lessons to a pracitical situation. Dedicated practice goes a long way, and it's not different with Blue Team competitions.

				<h2>Where to Begin</h2>
				<p>
				Look no further than this website! I've created this website to describe in depth how Blue Team competitions operate,
				what the key ideas to learn are, and how to execute them in these high-intensity settings. Among the information available
				on this website, you can look through: training resources, documentation I've written up for previous events, and the most
				well-known competitions to test your skills at when ready. Beyond this website, there are other great resources to be found
				online that will show you the ropes and provide the most crucial information to understand for performing well at such an event.

				<h2>What's the Plan</h2>
				<p>
				Through this website, we will teach the basics of Blue Teaming. This includes Linux command-line knowledge,
				networking concepts, security best practices, technical writing, working with a team, how to work under pressure,
				automation and manual configurations, what practice looks like, and much more. The only thing you need is the drive
				to learn. It might feel as though you are drinking through a firehose trying to absorb information at the start, but
				it is part of the process, and everyone starts somewhere. Join us for this in-depth walkthrough on how to be the most
				effective Blue Team member you can be!
